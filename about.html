            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate frontend developer with a hunger to build beautiful, accessible, and functional web experiences. 
                My journey into tech started with curiosity and has grown into a deep commitment to mastering the craft of 
                web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that great design meets great code at the intersection of user experience and technical excellence. 
                Every line of code I write is an opportunity to create something that makes the web a better place.

            <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
                The HNG Internship represents a pivotal moment in my development career. Here's what I'm determined to achieve:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Master Modern Frontend Technologies:</strong> Move beyond tutorials and build real-world applications with React, JavaScript, and modern CSS frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop Production-Ready Skills:</strong> Learn to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code that meets industry standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Build a Strong Portfolio:</strong> Create projects that showcase my abilities and demonstrate my problem-solving approach to potential employers.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborate Effectively:</strong> Learn to work in team environments, handle code reviews, and contribute to larger projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Land My First Tech Role:</strong> Use the skills and network from this program to secure a frontend developer position where I can grow and contribute.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas Where I'm Building Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                Growth requires honesty about where I am today. These are the areas where I'm actively working to improve:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced JavaScript Concepts:</strong> Closures, promises, async/await, and design patterns still require more practice and real-world application.</li>
                <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Understanding when and how to use tools like Redux or Context API in complex applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests is an area I need to develop more systematically.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Learning best practices for optimizing bundle sizes, lazy loading, and rendering performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend Integration:</strong> While I'm focused on frontend, understanding API design and backend concepts will make me a more effective developer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I view these not as weaknesses, but as opportunities for growth. Each challenge is a chance to level up.
            </p>

            <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>Dear Future Me,</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're reading this, you've made it through the HNG Internship. Remember this moment—when you were 
                    nervous about deadlines, uncertain about your skills, but determined to push through anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You chose to invest in yourself when it was uncomfortable. You stayed up late debugging, you asked 
                    questions when you didn't understand, and you shipped projects even when they weren't perfect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The imposter syndrome you felt? It meant you were challenging yourself. The frustration you experienced? 
                    It was growth in disguise. Every error message you encountered made you a better problem solver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep building. Keep learning. Keep shipping. The version of you today would be proud of how far you've come. 
                    And remember—you're just getting started.
                </p>

            <h2>Why This Matters to Me</h2>
            <p>
                Technology has the power to transform lives, and frontend development is where I can make that transformation 
                tangible and accessible. Every button, every form, every interaction is an opportunity to make someone's day 
                easier, their work more efficient, or their experience more delightful.
            </p>
            <p>
                The HNG Internship isn't just about learning to code—it's about joining a community of builders, problem-solvers, 
                and innovators. It's about proving to myself that with dedication and the right guidance, I can achieve things 
                I once thought were beyond my reach.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm here to work hard, learn fast, and build things that matter. Let's do this.
